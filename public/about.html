<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi everyone. Thank you for visiting my website. I have been doing programming since my high school days. I finished Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at the Technological Institute of the Philippines.</p>
<p>I landed my first job at a Japanese company but I only lasted 3 months. After that, I applied and got hired in a BPO company. Since 2008, I have been employed in BPO companies. I started out as a technical support representative, and then became a quality analyst, switched to a communications analyst, and then became a trainer, with technical and leadership side of it.</p>
<p>After my trainer role, I got transferred to the finance department, where I became a business controller. My current job has me as a profitability enabler, with the same functions as a business controller.</p>
<p>So this again is my basic website. I hope to learn and excel from this. I am also looking forward to have this website improved. </p>
